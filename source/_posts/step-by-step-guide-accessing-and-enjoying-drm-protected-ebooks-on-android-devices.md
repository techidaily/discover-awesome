When talking about eReaders, most people would say, "I like Kindle" or "I like iPad." Yes, they are well-known among eBook lovers. But, we can't deny that there is a group of people who use Android tablets or smartphones to read eBooks.

In today's article, let me provide some good tips for those Android lovers. Here, I'll discuss how to read DRM ePub on an Android tablet.

Without further ado, I will introduce you to two available methods. Choose the method you prefer.

* [Method 1: Install DRM supported ePub reader apps.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Method 2: Remove DRM from EPUB books.](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Method 1: Install DRM supported ePub reader apps

Here I want to settle this problem with 2 sorts: "special apps" and "general apps".

#### **Official apps:**

Here I mean those apps released from official ebook stores, such as Kobo, Nook, Sony, etc. These apps are special because they are only provided for their own books. For example, if we use Kobo app, we can only read books bought from Kobo store. And if we want to read other books bought from public websites, we have to install extra apps.

#### **General apps**:

This kind of epub reading apps are widely used on our devices because they are not dedicated to the store. Whether can we read one book is not depended on where this book purchased from, but depended on what format this book is, and what DRM this book is protected by. For example, the Aldiko, it can read all books if they are in epub or pdf format with Adobe drm.

The biggest benefit of these apps is that there is no need for us to install additional apps. We can even say that just with these apps we can read books from all over the stores.

Here is a simple list for epub reading apps on android.

**\*1:**In March 2014, Sony abandoned the US and Canada markets, so Sony eReader users in those countries had to transfer to Kobo.

**\*2:** There are many other general apps that you can use and install from the Google Play Store.

From this list, you can see that there are numerous ePub reading apps available for Android tablets. So, you may find it challenging to select one. Here is my advice:

If you only read books from one store, choose the store's own Android app from official app. 

Let's take the Kobo Android App as an example. 

**Step 1.** Download [Kobo Books - Reading app for Android.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kobobooks.android) You can download it from website or through Google Play on your android devices. 

**Step 2.** Register with your Kobo account in Kobo for Android app .

**Step 3.** Sync Kobo books to your tablets or smartphones via wifi.

If you read books purchased from many bookstores, choose a suitable ePub reader app from general apps.

### Method 2: Remove DRM from EPUB

You may only want to install one reading app to manage and read all ebooks Android device, but the books were bought or downloaded from different eBook stores. In such case, removing DRM from epub books is the best choice.

It is easy to learn from the above form that epub files we got from different places will be mainly encrypted by three kinds of DRM: **_Adobe DRM, KOBO DRM and Nook DRM_**.

So if we get a tool that helps us remove the 3 types of DRM limitation, our epub books will be free to read on any reading app.

Here I recommend you [**Epubor Ultimate**](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It can remove Kobo DRM, Adobe DRM, Kindle DRM and Nook DRM effectively.

Let's download and install the Epubor Ultimate free trial version to the computer before starting the following steps.

1Remove Adobe DRM from ePub books

The majority of epub books are protected by Adobe DRM, including Kobo, Google play books, and many small ebook stores.

**Step 1.** Install [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html) to your computer, and then authorize it with your Adobe ID (Normally, it's the same email address as your eBook store's account).

Your article says "So here is another way for you to read drm epub on android tablet." but only gives downloads for Windows or Apple. Is there, in fact, a version for Android?

If you want to read the DRM-protected books on android, you can install a epub reader app for android which support drm books.This is method 1 suggested.  
 But please understand that you can't remove the books DRM directly on your android device.You need to do it on your computer and then you can transfer the drm free epub books to android devices for reading with any ePub apps. That's why the download tool is only for windows or mac version.

And removing DRM unless it is your own content is illegal
