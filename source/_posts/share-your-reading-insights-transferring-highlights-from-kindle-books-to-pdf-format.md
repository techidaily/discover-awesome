hello johnny  
 your epubor software is really nice but i am looking for a way to remove the limitations on how many highlighted notes i can export.  
 after one has processed the kindle book with epubor, are the restrictions on the amount of highlighted text that i can export, removed?  
 best wishes

Hi Jonny,

 Here is another option: www.notehound.com

 Please feel free to try it!

When I added the Myclippings.txt file from kidnle to the software. It did not detect any books. Any way around that ? Or any possible step that I am skipping?

 Any advice?
