A video resolution converter is highly demanded to change resolution of a video file, e.g. from 4k to 1080p, 720p to 480p, so as to improve compatibility with portable devices. For instance, when you try to put a video with a resolution of 1280x720 into your iPhone X/8/8 Plus featuring a 1334x750 display, you will notice the black bars on both sides during playing, which ruins your visual experience. So you have to rely on a [video resolution converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to decrease video resolution from 1280x720 to 640x480 for better playback or [upscale video resolution from HD to 4K UHD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for 4K TVs or 4k-supported streaming sites.

## Part 1: Why You Need Convert Video Resolution

###  1\. Reduce video resolution for mobile devices

The mobile devices have a specific requirement for video resolution. At the same time, the high-quality video featuring higher resolution in 1080p or 720p, though delivering crisper image, engulfs a large amount of storage space of your iPhone iPad. For better HD video playback on iPhone, iPad, Android or other gadgets without taking too much space, you need to reduce the resolution of HD video from 1280x720 to 640x480, 1280x720 to 720x480, etc. This is also a good practice to [compress video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), e.g. from [4k to 1080p](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/), [1080p to 720p](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

\* Best video resolution for iDevices such as iPhone X/8/7, iPad Pro: 640x480  
 \* Best video resolution for Android Samsung, HTC, etc: 720x480  
 \* Best video resolution for Microsoft WP8, Xbox, Surface, Zune: 720x480, 320x240.  
 \* Best video resolution for Sony PS4, PS3, PSP: 720x480, 368x208  
 \* Best video resolution for Apple TV: 640x480

###  2\. Process video resolution for burning a new DVD

The popularity of burning video to DVD for preservation spawns the increasing need of a video resolution converter. For example, if you've saved some low-resolution videos, you need to increase the video resolution, e.g. from 320x240 to 720x480\. This is because the DVD standard asks for the video resolution no less than 720x480\. See how to [convert MP4 to DVD](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). 

**Note:** It's common to downscale video resolution but rare to upscale video resolution, since increasing the resolution of a video doesn't improve the image quality but enlarges the video file size. 

\* Best video resolution for DVD burning: 720x480\.

### 3\. Change video resolution for uploading to YouTube Facebook 

If you need to upload your videos online for sharing and better viewing experience, you shall bear in mind the right video resolution plays a decisive role. Or else, there be black bars all around the video. So to fit the player perfectly, please process video resolution to the ones below: 

\* Recommended resolution for YouTube uploading: 3840x2160, 2560x1440, 1920x1080, 1280x720, 854x480, 640x360 and 426x240\.   
 \* The ideal Facebook video dimension is: 1280x720   
 \* Best video resolution for Instagram: maximally 1920x1080

### 4\. Upscale video resolution for 4K TVs or Monitors or 4K Supported Sites 

4K TV has a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels. The good news is that the UHD TV has the upscaling technology that claims to upscale the video resolution and make a 1080p image look good. But test shows it is not appreciably better than 1080p on a HD TV and even difficult with the lower resolution videos. Some people even notice blurry images after upconverting the video resolution with the 4k UHD upscaler. So a video resolution upconverter that can [convert 1080P HD video resolution to 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)for playback on 4K televisions, monitors or other 4k supported streaming sites. [Check the 4K Video Processing Tool >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) 

\* Recommended resolution for 4K TV: 3840x2160

### External Resources: 

**Common Types of Video Resolution**  
 Video resolution is usually regarded as width and height in pixels. For instance, the 1080x720 means the width is 1080 pixels and the height is 720 pixels. There are 3 main types of video resolution nowadays.

**1\. SD:** also known as standard definition. The most popular SD resolution is 640x360 or 640x480.

**2\. HD:** also known as high definition. There are two main HD video resolutions: 1280x720 and 1920x1080\. The former is also called HD Ready for television channel broadcasting and DVD burning, while the latter refers to Full HD for HDTV high definition video with a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9\. 

**3\. 4K:** 4K has a resolution of 4096x2160 pixels or 3840x2160 pixels. Right now, YouTube supports uploading 4K videos while iPhone 7 also supports 4k video recording. So you can download 4k videos with ease. It will definitely become the mainstream standard for distribution. But 4k video is huge in file size. Many mobile users are prone to be out of space and want to change video resolution from 4k to 1080p for less storage occupation.
