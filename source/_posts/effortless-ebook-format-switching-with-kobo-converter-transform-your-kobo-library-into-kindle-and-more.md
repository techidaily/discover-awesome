If you are a big eBook fan, I guess in addition to purchasing books from Amazon, Kobo eBook store is another place you usually go, as Kobo is also one of the popular eBook retailers on the market. To sync and read Kobo books, you may have installed Kobo desktop on your computer, but the problem is after you download purchased Kobo books, you found that they are not the normal format, such as EPUB or PDF, but Kepub files. How can I read these Kepub files on my Kindle, Nook eReader or iBooks? How can we get the normal Kindle, PDF and EPUB format? Obviously, the best way is to convert Kobo Kepub files format. Thus, a professional Kobo converter is necessary for us. In this article, I will exactly talk about the related information about this program and how to use it. Hope this can help you.
