## 2\. Free Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with Handbrake

 **Best for free converting VOB/Video\_TS folder VOB to MP4** 

How could we miss Handbrake? Handbrake is the second-to-none video transcoder yet free open source software in video & DVD converting field. It works like a charm in converting videos from almost any format into MP4, MKV, or WebM. Your DVDs are supported seamlessly by it, as well. Therefore, you can use it to convert VOB video or a Video\_TS folder to MP4\. There are a wide selection of pre-programmed settings to help you compress large-sized VOB videos to smaller MP4\. 

A warm prompt is that you'd better upgrade your Handbrake to version 1.5.0 or above. This is because the newer version has fixed couples of issues that you matter a lot, including fixed an issue on older Intel CPUs causing the CLI to fail to initialize, updated Intel Quick Sync to use the Intel oneAPI Video Processing Library, fixed FFmpeg AAC audio encoder quality mode scale range, etc. After all the preparation jobs are done, check the below guide on how to free turn VOB into MP4 with Handbrake. 

Pros:

Both VOB and Video\_TS folder supported.

Free, open source.

Cons:

Unable to remove DRM from video/DVD on its own.

Limited hardware encoder, only VideoToolbox available.

### How to Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac Free with Handbrake?

**Note:** Before you start, you should know that Handbrake can only handle videos/DVDs without DRM. If the VOB video is ripped from an encrypted DVD, the VOB video may contain copy protection. Handbrake can't convert encrypted VOB videos to MP4\. You can [download the libdvdcss on your Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and try again. 

Step 1\. Free download Handbrake on your Mac and double-click on the dmg file to run it.

Step 2\. Click Open Source to select and load the VOB or Video\_TS folder into it. 

Step 3\. Click the Format dropdown menu under the Output Settings section and choose MP4\. Handbrake allows you to convert VOB to MP4 in H.264 or H.265\. It's set to MP4 H.264 by default.

###  MacX vs Handbrake Test Comparison in VOB to MP4 Converting:

 In comparison, MacX Video Converter Pro shows times faster than Handbrake, while the output quality is almost the same (it's very very hard to notice the differences and the quality depends on personal feeling). Check the test results below (Also note that the test results involve heavily the computer configuration, a higher configuration will see better results):

**Source video:** a 720P VOB file of 5min 2s, 76.3MB, we converted the VOB file to MP4 h.264

* **Handbrake:**
* **MacX Video Converter Pro:**
* Conversion time: 3min 31s
* Conversion time: 49s
* encoding method: Apple VideoToolbox, AMD VCE or Intel Quick Sync Video unavailable.
* encoding method: GPU AMD VCE, Intel QSV, Nvidia NVENC, VideoToolbox hardware encoder all supported.
* Speed: around 35fps
* Speed: around 180fps

## 3\. Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with VLC Media Player

 **A 100% free VOB player and converter for Mac** 

Many users rely on VLC to play different videos. It's free and open-source to play a wide range of videos. Do you know you can also use VLC as a free VOB to MP4 converter? In fact, VLC is able to convert videos from one format to the other. It supports VOB video, Video\_TS VOB, DVD, network files, and recordings. 

Given that VLC is primarily designed to be a media player, not a media encoder/transcoder, the VOB to MP4 converting speed and performance are not as good as other free VOB to MP4 converters for Mac listed here. The hardware decoder in Preferences is usally on by default. Yet, the hardware encoder needs to manually turn on, which is not easy to be found. You can follow [this guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/winxdvd/products/) to activate hardware encoder in VLC. 

That being said, VLC only supports Apple OpenGL CVPX hw encoder, Intel QSV, AMD VCE or Nvidia NVENC unavailable so far. So the conversion speed becomes a tradeoff for you to understand a free open source application.

Pros:

Free VOB to MP4 converter, downloader, player.

 Easy to use, especially friendly to newbies.

Cons:

Only Apple OpenGL CVPX hardware encoder supported.

Video audio out of sync error happens now and then.

 **Free convert VOB videos to MP4 on Mac with built-in Mac player**

QuickTime Player lacks the direct capability to export videos as MP4 files. However, you can still employ QuickTime to convert VOB to MOV on your Mac. Afterward, you'll need to adjust the file extension from .mov to .mp4\. Keep in mind that movies saved in audio format will be stored as MPEG4 audio files. This method is convenient if you already have QuickTime on your Mac and prefer not to install additional software. To be cautious, it's advisable to create a backup of the original VOB files, as the final file might become corrupted during the renaming process. Here are the steps to follow. 

Pros:

Free and easy.

Mac built-in video player.

Cons:

Unable to convert VOB to MP4 directly.

### How to Free Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with QuickTime?

Step 1\. Open the QuickTime Player application on your Mac, then navigate to File > Export As. Choose an option from the Export menu.

Step 2\. If you selected either the 4K or 1080p export resolution, click on the Format drop-down menu. From there, you have two options:

Select "Smaller File Size" to export the movie in HEVC format.

Opt for "Greater Compatibility" to export the movie in H.264 format.

Step 3\. Provide a name for your exported file and select a destination. Click Save. Proceed to import the .vob movies into .mov format, and subsequently, rename the .mov file to .mp4 on your Mac.

## 10\. Export and Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac with iMovie

 **Convert VOB videos to MP4 on Mac with built-in Mac editor**

A Mac user inquired, "Years ago, I recorded a video with my camcorder and saved it onto a DVD. Now, I'm attempting to import these videos from the DVD into iMovie so I can split them into several videos for sharing on YouTube. The videos are in VOB format. Can I export VOB to MP4 on Mac using iMovie?"

iMovie's High Quality setting facilitates the conversion of VOB files to MP4 on Mac. Simply import your .vob files into iMovie and proceed to export them. The resulting files will be in MP4/AAC format across all iMovie settings except for Best Quality (pro res), which yields a file size four times larger than the MP4 due to its significantly higher bitrate. Therefore, for space efficiency, it's recommended to use the High Quality setting rather than Best Quality (pro res). 

Pros:

Free and easy.

Mac built-in video editor.

Cons:

No flexible settings.

Limited output/input format support.

If these methods don’t work for you, you can try an online solution. Online converters offer a convenient way to convert VOB files to MP4 on the go.

Additionally, security concerns might arise when uploading your files.

For the most control and efficiency, consider dedicated desktop software like MacX Video Converter Pro. This program offers several advantages:

* Faster conversion speed: Leverage multi-core CPU and GPU hardware acceleration for quicker processing.

For occasional conversions, built-in applications or online tools might suffice. Consider factors like file size, desired features, and budget when making your decision.

### 2\. Vob conversion error with subtitles

Another common problem with Mac freeware involves video subtitles. For example, "I've converted the VOB files to MP4's, but the subtitles are gone! All I really need is a program that will keep the subs ON, after conversion from a VOB.", or "the subs are improperly synced with the audio in the exported MP4, while the vob file ripped from DVD was OK."

### 3\. Vob to mp4 conversion on mac finishes parts only

Sometimes the free tool won't convert the full VOB files without giving any reason. After an hour or so, the ended file gives about 1/3 the size and it only gets the first part finished in MP4 format.

### 5\. Incorrect aspect ratio

The output MP4 videos are different from the original vob files on the display screens. As a user complain that "the new mp4 file was about 50% of the original width and therefore the videos are distorted." For those who want the picture to fill the entire screen of the TV or computer, the distorted or out-of-shape image looks really disappointing. 

### 6\. Audio/Video out of sync

"I am attempting to convert the VOB files to MP4 for more compatible use on Mac but have issues with the audio once the conversion is complete. The audio first starts out correct but later on it starts to go out-of-sync." Some users are experiencing A/V out of sync errors after they convert VOB to MP4 on Mac, while some others get no audio after the conversion. 

To get rid of any of the above errors, get MacX Video Converter Pro and freely convert VOB to MP4 videos on Mac (macOS 13 Ventura incl.)

## Part 3\. FAQs about How to Convert VOB to MP4 on Mac

**1\. Can I play VOB files on Mac?**

No, you can't play VOB videos natively using Mac QuickTime. But both the built-in video players in Windows and Mac - Windows Media Player and QuickTime do not support the VOB format. To open VOB videos on Mac, you can try a third-party player like VLC, or convert VOB to MP4 for QuickTime.

**2\. Can you open a VOB file on a Mac?**

On a Mac, opening a VOB (Video Object) file is possible through various applications. VLC Media Player, a versatile and widely-used player, natively supports VOB files and can be easily downloaded for free. QuickTime Player, while not initially compatible with VOB, can be extended to play these files with the addition of a codec pack like Perian. iMovie, Apple's video editing software, can import and edit VOB files, making it another viable option. HandBrake, primarily a video converter, also functions as a player and can handle VOB files.

 **3\. How do I convert VOB files to iMovie on Mac?** 

Same to QuickTime, iMovie doesn't support VOB format, not to mention converting VOB to MP4 using iMovie. You need to convert the VOB files to Mp4/AAC, and then import them into iMovie.

**4\. How do I convert a VOB file to QuickTime?**

First, download and install a reliable video converter program like MacX Video Converter or Any Video Converter. Open the converter and import the VOB file by clicking the "Add" button. Next, choose the output format as MOV or MP4, both of which are compatible with QuickTime. Finally, initiate the conversion process by clicking the "RUN" button. Once the conversion is complete, you'll have a file in a format that QuickTime can play. Simply open QuickTime Player, go to "File," select "Open File," and choose the converted MOV or MP4 file to watch it in QuickTime.

**5\. Can I merge multiple VOB files into one MP4 video?**

Yes. Handbrake doesn't provide a function to merge videos. You can use MacX DVD ripper, or the command line of VLC and FFmpeg to merge VOB videos into an MP4 video. MacX DVD ripper is the easiest way: to merge multiple VOB files together, you simply need to select all the VOB titles before you click Run. 

**6\. How do I convert VOB to MP4 on Mac for free?**

There are lots of free VOB video converter for Mac, such as MacX Video Converter Pro, VLC Media Player, QuickTime, FFmpeg, Handbrake, online VOB video converters. FFmpeg and Handbrake are open source and popular video transcoder that can also convert VOB to MP4 on Mac. If quality and speed are factors that you care, MacX Video Converter Pro is a good choice.

###  Extended Knowledge of VOB to MP4: 

**[VOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VOB)**: VOB is a container format in DVD-Video media that contains audio, video, subtitles, DVD menus, and other contents. VOB can be played by a DVD player, and a few video players like Windows Media Player and VLC Media Player. However, vob is not supported by all mobile devices, editors like Windows Movie Maker, Final Cut Pro, iMovie, etc., and video sharing sites. The good part is that VOB keeps very low compression. 

**[MP4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4%5FPart%5F14)**: MP4 is a digital multimedia container format most commonly used to store video, audio, and subtitles. MP4 is the widest-supported format which is compatible with almost all mobiles, players, websites, editors etc. Besides, mp4 is a format that well balances the quality and file size. If you change a VOB to MP4 for small screens, you can hardly notice any quality differences.
