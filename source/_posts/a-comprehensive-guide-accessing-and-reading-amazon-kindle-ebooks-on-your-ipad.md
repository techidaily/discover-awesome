As one of the most popular tablets in the world, iPad is always attracting many people's attention. With this 12.9-inch iPad, we can read eBooks more conveniently on the big screen. On the other hand, Amazon provides us with various eBooks of lower price, so many eBook lovers may prefer to purchasing books from Amazon. While Amazon confines us to read Kindle books with its own app or device exclusively, many of us may have thought about how to read Kindle books on iPad. This is exactly what I will talk about in this article. Here we've found 3 alternative solutions for you.

### 2\. Read Kindle books on iPad with iBooks

Don't want to install too many apps on your iPad or iPhone? Can I read kindle books on iPad without Kindle App? Can I read kindle books in Apple books? You may be confused: iBooks doesn't support Kindle books at all. Yes, it's true. We cannot read Kindle books in iBooks directly. But where there's a will, there's a way. As long as we understand the reasons that prevent us from reading Kindle books on iBooks, we can find a suitable solution to the problem.

On one hand, our downloaded Kindle books are always DRM protected. On the other hand, Kindle books are in Amazon's unique formats, which are not supported by iBooks. So what we need to do is remove the DRM from Kindle-protected books and convert the decrypted Kindle books to EPUB or PDF formats, which are compatible with iBooks. Therefore, a DRM removal tool and an eBook converter are needed. Here, I highly recommend a powerful software called [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/), which is an all-in-one tool that offers both DRM decryption and eBook conversion features. With this software, there's no need to install two separate tools. Additionally, it's easy to use, and I believe everyone can quickly figure out how to use it.

Now please follow the steps below to make our Kindle books readable on iBooks. 

#### Step 1: Sync your Kindle books via Kindle for PC/Mac

First of all, please sync your purchased books via [Kindle for PC/Mac](https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/kcp-landing-page/). Just double-click the cover of Kindle books and download them to your computer. This step can help Epubor Ultimate to locate your Kindle register info and generate the decryption key upon your Kindle account.

Launch the program, it will detect and upload your downloaded Kindle books automatically. Click on “Kindle” tab, and you’ll see all your Kindle books are listed in the left side column. You can also drag and drop the Kindle books to the main interface of the program. The Kindle DRM are removed automatically from your Kindle books when they’re loaded to the program.

You can see a checkmark and "Decrypted" next to the Kindle books you've removed DRM from. Double click on "Decrypted", the decrypted file output folder will prompt automatically.

### Conclusion

That's all I want to share with you. The three methods mentioned above can help us enjoy Kindle books on an iPad. Personally, I prefer the second, more efficient method: unlocking DRM-protected Kindle books and converting kindle to epub/pdf. This way, we can enjoy Kindle books with iBooks/Apple books without any limitations. After all, it's really annoying to install too many apps just to read books downloaded from different eBook retailers. Anyway, you can choose any of the three methods that suit you best to read Kindle books on your iPad. I hope this helps solve your problem.
