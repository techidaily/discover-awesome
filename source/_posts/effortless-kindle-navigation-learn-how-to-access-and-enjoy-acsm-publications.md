 If you download an eBook from an online eBook store and want to read the book on your Kindle eReader, the solution is to convert the ACSM file to kindle format. You might wonder why and how to do this. Don't worry, as this article will provide you with a comprehensive answer.

To read acsm on a Kindle, follow these 4 steps.

Step 1  Using Adobe Digital Editions to open your ACSM files.

Step 2  Once opened, the ACSM will be saved as ePub or PDF.

Step 3  Remove DRM from the ACSM.

Step 4  Convert ACSM to Kindle supported format.

![how to convert acsm to kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/how-to-convert-acsm-to-kindle.jpg)

The following 4 parts will address all your questions.

### Part 1: What's an ACSM File

After you purchase an eBook online from the public library or a private bookseller, you can download it to have a look.

![what the acsm file is](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/what-is-acsm-file.png) However, typically the downloaded file uses an .acsm suffix. In other words, the majority of the books you got from online stores are in [ACSM format](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

You may be confused about this file type since the acsm is not your actual eBook. It's actually a download link to your eBook.

### Part 2: How to Open with ACSM File

#### 1\. Can you open ACSM file on Kindle?

No, you can’t open an ACSM file directly on a Kindle. ACSM files are typically used to download eBooks from Adobe Digital Editions, and they contain information for downloading and activating the eBook on an Adobe-supported reader. Unfortunately, kindle is not the official reader for opening the acsm file and you cannot install ADE on your Kindle. 

#### 2\. How to open ACSM file?

ACSM stands for Adobe Content Server Manager. This name suggests that Adobe manages the downloading of the ACSM file. To read an ACSM file, you need to use Adobe Digital Editions. No matter you are on windows, mac, even the android or ios device, you can [open ACSM file](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). 

I would recommend using Adobe program [Adobe Digital Editions](http://www.adobe.com/products/digital-editions.html) to open your acsm file. It's also the best acsm ebook reader.

**![install ADE to open acsm file](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ADE.png) Step 1,** create an Adobe account and authorize it.

**Step 2,** run ADE program and open acsm with it.

Double click acsm file and ADE will automatically start downloading your book as PDF or ePub, which is the actual eBook you purchased.

**Step 3,** read acsm file in ADE. ([how to read books on ADE](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/))

**Tips:**

ACSM files restrict reproduction and transfer, limiting their use to the computer where the books were downloaded. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize that before purchasing Adobe eBooks, whether in PDF or ePub format, you should install Adobe Digital Editions. This software is necessary to open ACSM file and read the eBook on your computer. 

### Part 3: How to Add ACSM File to Kindle

As mentioned earlier, the ACSM file can only be opened using Adobe Digital Editions (ADE) on your PC. If you attempt to open the file with any other application, such as Kindle for PC, an error message will be popped up.

This is because once an ACSM file is downloaded and opened with ADE, it becomes associated with ADE (**Adobe Adept DRM**). It is not compatible with Kindle or iPad. Furthermore, if you wish to read ACSM on Kindle, you will encounter another issue aside from the DRM protection – format limitations. Kindles support their own formats such as AZW3, AZW, MOBI, PRC, and TPZ, but not the common ePub or PDF formats. 

Therefore, the key to resolving your problem and enabling you to read ACSM on Kindle lies in two steps: removing Adobe DRM and converting ACSM to kindle format.

![remove drm and convert the format](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/drm-and-format-problem.jpg)

By following the steps below and installing [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It is the best DRM Removal + eBook Converter.

1Install Epubor Ultimate.

2Remove Adobe DRM.

When you launch Epubor Ultimate, you will see your downloaded ACSM file are listed under Adobe tab on the left side panel. All you need to do is to add your files to the right main window to remove DRM.

![decrypt googleplay book](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/decrypt-googleplay-book.png)

As you can see, DRM will be removed automatically. You can also have a look at [how to remove DRM from .acsm file](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

**Notice:**

If you download Kobo eBooks from Kobo official site, the downloaded file will be ACSM. But, if the books are downloaded via Kobo for PC/Mac, the file will be Kepub instead of acsm. If you want to read Kobo on your Kindle, you should read this article regarding [how to read Kobo kepub on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

3Convert ACSM to Kindle

In the drop-down output format menu, you can select Mobi/AZW3 as the output format. Then click the convert button to start the conversion.

![convert acsm to kindle](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-acsm-to-kindle.png)

Here is a video guide for you.

### Part 4: How to Read ACSM Files on Kindle

After the successful conversion, click Succeeded or the book folder icon on the upper right corner of the software to find your converted files. Now all that remains is just to [send the converted mobi to Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Connect your Kindle device and computer via USB cable, then copy your converted acsm file to your Kindle document folder.

Enjoy your new eBooks!

 2, Check if you are authorizing the correct account which is the owner of the book

OK the Google Play books can be decrypted correctly. The most possible reason is the Adobe ID database is messed up.

 The most solid solution is find a new computer which hasn't installed Adobe Digital Editions yet.

 Or you can try to reinstall ADE or use some apps like CCleaner to clean the remaining information of ADE.

Good day, I am just wondering the converted MOBI format will work the same as a native MOBI file? Would their properties be the same? For instance, can I still highlight notes and save them for future access?

Hi,

 Yes, converted Mobi format will keep the original content without quality losing.

 Maybe you can have a try to see, converted files will not replace your original Mobi books.

Hello, I'm trying to convert an Adobe e-book (acsm file) to Kindle (Kindle for Mac). I've selected Kindle as my output format and the "E-book Converting" message has been up for several minutes now, with the blue loading-bar full from the start. Does that mean it's still working? If so, how long might a 118mb file take?

 Also, am I doing this wrong/ is there a better way to do this?

 Thanks, Ryan

 It seems your file is a little bit large, it may take a while for converting.

 As long as the conversion has been finished, the output folder will pop up automatically.

Hello,

 I want to use Kindle for Mac to read my book that is currently on Adobe Digital editions (ADE). Based on this page, my plan was to convert the ACSM file to a MOBI file so I can read the book on Kindle for Mac. 

 But, I am confused because: This page mentioned that once ADE opens the ACSM file, it becomes a PDF file. The page also says that you must first open the ACSM file in ADE, and then convert the ACSM file to a MOBI file using Ultimate software. BUT, if I have opened the ACSM with ADE, the ACSM file is now a PDF! That is, when I look in the right side area of the Ultimate software under ADE, my book is a PDF! 

 Am I supposed to convert this PDF to a MOBI file? - This method doesn't allow for the removing of the DRM from the ACSM step above; when I select this PDF to convert to MOBI using the software, and then open it in the Kindle for Mac reader, It becomes a messed-up mix of letters and partial pages; so I don't think this is the way. If it is, what am I doing wrong?

 If I am supposed to be selecting an ACSM file from the right side of the Ultimate software under the ADE tab, how do I make it appear there?

 Thank you, Sean

 Yes, the correct step is: open acsm file via ADE, download complete PDF, launch our Ultimate, drag PDF file to it, the DRM will be removed automatically. Then convert PDF to Mobi.

You can only download ADE to your computer(PC or Mac), then make sure you can read your ACSM with ADE.

 Once your ACSM saved as ePub or PDF, using the tool to help you convert your book to Mobi.

 Then, transfer Mobi to your Kindle Fire.

 This problem is because of safari. Safari decides extension of file automatically and my folder's content is xml but it is a link and after download must be .acsm extensson not acsm.xml  
 How can I prevent safari to not check folder's contain.

Hey, it seems that the formatting of EPUB from ADE goes to complete bust in the trial version. In both saved EPUB and PDF versions the book completely lost original formatting. The covers disappeared too, also the trial file has text from random chapters. Decryption alone saves the txt file in a trial? Is that correct?
