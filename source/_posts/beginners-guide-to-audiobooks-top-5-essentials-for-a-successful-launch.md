### Why you should listen to audiobooks

#### 1\. Speed 

First and foremost, listening to audiobook is way much quicker. And you can acquire more information with less time. For example, an average 300 pages book usually takes a month to finish, however, you will only need 5 hours when the book is converted to audiobook. 

####  2\. Convenient 

Listening stuff is more convenient than reading it. For example, you can listen to audiobook while driving, but there's no way for you to read it. So listening to audiobook is very practical. 

#### 3\. Portable 

You can put hundreds of audiobooks on a device and listen to them any time you want. But with a physical book, it's not possible.

### Tip 1: Subscribe to Audible for Best of Best Audiobooks

[Audible](http://www.audible.com/), Amazon owned, has become the world's largest producer of downloadable audiobooks.If you first sign in Audible with your Amazon account, you'll get an audiobook of your choice, free, with a 30-day trial. After the trial, your paid membership will begin at $14.95 per month. With your membership, you will receive one credit every month, good for any audiobook on Audible. You can cancel subscription anytime.If you cancel before your trial ends, you will not be charged. 

If you really like Audible and continue the subscription, then [Audible Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/audible-converter/) is a must-have software for you. Audible Converter is the best AA/AAX to MP3 converter to remove DRM and convert protected audiobooks from Audible. The coolest thing about this software is that you can try it free for a month. What's more, it's very easy to use. You just need to add your audible books to it, then choose your favorite output audio format. There are so many audio output formats for you to choose from, like MP3, AAC, AC3, M4A, M4B, FLAC, OGG, AIFF, WMA, WAV...Then you can put the converted DRM free audiobooks on any of your device which supports the converted audiobook format. So you can listen to your audiobook anytime and anywhere your want.
