[How to move Audible book from Fire to USB stick for car](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) \-- 6/17/2021 2:47:09 AM 

Would like to move Audible book from Fire to USB stick for car. I do not download my books into itunes, in fact have never used itunes. I did just put my Bible CDs onto a USB stick, but I just ripped them with Roxio, then copied them onto the USB stick. (New car has no CD player.) A single USB stick would be much easier, than setting up Fire on AUX, plus should not leave Fire in hot car.
