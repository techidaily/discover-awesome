Why we need to convert ibook to pdf? Suppose that you have purchased a few iBooks within iBookstore, and you want to share them with your parents, but they do not have an iPad. Then what would you do? Or maybe you have created an iBook by iBooks Author that works perfectly on your iPad, but now you want to read them on different devices like the Nook, Kobo, or Kindle, then how to deal with such situation?

Usually in this case I will suggest you to **convert ibook to pdf**, because:

\--iBooks Author .ibooks file extension can be read on computer or other devices only by converting to pdf (exported to .pdf).

\--iBooks books primarily are with epub format, and only readable on iPad, iPod or iPhone, with DRM limitation. Not available to read iBook on another devices.

\--Some eReaders support PDF format better than ePub format.

\--Kindle supports PDF format, but doesn't support epub. So if we want to read ibook on Kindle, it's necessary to convert to pdf.

\--For those books which have images, diagrams, or anything else like that, they are better as pdf format.

Here I will guide you how to convert iBook to PDF. And you'd better remove iBooks DRM and convert ebook format for better reading experience as well as share your iBook with your friends or family.

### Situation 1: Convert .ibooks to pdf

What's iBooks Author document? It's a document created by iBooks Author (iBA), a program used to create iBooks for Apple iPad. IBA files are saved in a .zip format, so we can open them with any zip decompression program to see the contents.

IBA file can be exported to the .ibooks format, if you just want to upload it to your iPad or share with others. Choose File > Export, then select iBooks.

But if you want to read ibook on other devices, you'd better export .ibooks to .pdf. Choose Share > Export, then click PDF. Select image quality and security options, click Next, input a name and choose a location for this file, and click Export.

![export ibook to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/export-ibook-to-pdf.jpg)

### Situation 2: Convert ibook epub to pdf

This part "ibook" is aimed at those books purchased or downloaded from iBookstore. For most of them are with epub format, so all we need is to convert ibook epub to pdf.

We know iBooks is an amazing ebook library and reading app. But the fact is that books from iBookstore are with Apple Fairplay DRM, which prevents us reading them on non-Apple eReaders and reading apps. So before converting iBooks to PDF, we must remove iBooks DRM first.

#### Step 1: Make iBook Convertable

**First**, for successfully iBooks DRM removing, find your downloaded iBooks on your computer please. Usually the location is: ...\\My Documents\\My Music\\iTunes\\iTunes Media\\Books.

![find ibooks on computer](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/find-ibooks-in-computer.png)

**Then**, install this tool [Requiem](http://download.epubor.com/sold/ibooksdrmremoval/requiem-4.1-mac.zip). Run this tool that I recommended, it will help you remove DRM from purchased ibooks books, then you will not bond with iBooks app any more.

##### Q: The Requiem doesn't work with iTunes 11.0, why? And what should I do?

A: The requiem drm tool only works great on iTunes 10.5 or 10.6 (10.5.3 is highly recommended). So if you are using iTunes 11.0 or later, you should uninstall it, then downgrade to 10.5 or 10.6, delete your books from the iTunes library window, re-download the book under iTunes 10.5 or 10.6.

##### Q: After Requiem runs, where does it output to? And where to find my original files?

A: You will see "recycle bin" on pc, in fact it replaces all your original files after drm removing. If you want to find original files, check "Recycle Bin" again. You can [visit this blog](http://ebookconverter.blogspot.com/2012/07/requiem-key-not-found-solutions-for.html#Q4) to find out more FAQ about requiem.

#### Step 2: Convert DRM free iBooks to PDF

**First of all**, download [eBook Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/) to your computer and run it. It's a good ibook to pdf converter.

[Windows Version Download](http://download.epubor.com/epubor-converter.exe) [Mac Version Download](http://download.epubor.com/epubor-converter.zip) 

**Then**, click on "Add" button to upload your drm free ibooks. If your have successfully remove drm from iBook, this tool can detect drm free files automatically. In other words, in this step you just need to add those drm free epub books to this program.

**To continue**, select "PDF" as your output format. This tool provides you 2 common font settings for you, common A4 font or default large font(new version onlys provides common A4 font output).

**Finally**, just click "Convert" to begin iBooks epub to pdf convertion.

![convert ibook epub to pdf](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/convert-ibooks-to-pdf.png)

 Update: New version of epubor ultimate delete the devices output options. 

From output folder, you will see your converted pdf files. Now you can transfer them to your non-IOS devices, such as Kobo, Nook, Kindle. Or transfer them to those softwares on your computer, such as Adobe Reader, Stanza, Calibre, etc. What's more, you can share your own files with your friends or family members (but not for commercial benefit please).

Hello Ada.

 Thank you for the useful information you share.

 I just want to tell that it would be good to precise at the beginnig of step 2 for the situation 2, that epubor converter will only recognize files with .epub or .pdf extensions but not those with .ibooks extension.

 Regards,

 Alex

Hi,

 Thank you for your comment.

 If you want to deal with .ibooks file, situation 1 has stated it clearly. Method in situation 2 refers to EPUB books purchased from iBookstore, not including .ibooks.

Hi Ms. Ada Wang, I am a writer and lost my computer and also portable memory so I lost .pdf and .doc of my novel which was published in iTunes. It was a decade ago. Can you help, please, to change .ebooks back to .pdf and .doc as well if it is possible? I need to work with this book because I am going to publish it as a hardcover. Thanks in advance, Isaac Jacobovsky
