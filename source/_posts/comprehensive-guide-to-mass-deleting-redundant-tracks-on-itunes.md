### How to Mass Delete iTunes Duplicate Songs?

_"My iTunes music library has duplicated my entire music library. I can delete these duplicates individually but it will take me possibly **hundreds of hours**. How can I mass delete duplicates in iTunes?"_

Using iTunes to find and delete duplicate songs is easy, but doesn't necessarily mean fast. Apple provides an option to show all duplicates, no option to remove all of them with one click. It could be a daunting task using iTunes features to manually select and remove all the duplicates of the whole iTunes music library, especially there are tons of tracks. As a matter of fact, music lovers nagged by such problem are not in the minority. Luckily, there are paid and free apps to bulk delete duplicates in iTunes with huge time savings. Below are two famous iTunes duplicates removers that you can download and try. 

\* Dupin Lite (OS X) 

 \* DeDuper (Windows)

### Why does iTunes Duplicate Songs?

Sometimes, new duplicate tracks appear with little cloud icons right after the duplicates are deleted. To stop iTunes from duplicating songs any more in the future, we have to go to the root of the problem. Currently, Apple doesn't provide an official reason for why duplicates are being created in iTunes, but there are a few things that may cause the problem concluded by experienced Apple users.

1\. Tracks **purchased or downloaded elsewhere** (ripped from CD, downloaded online, shared with friends, purchased from artists' site, other stores, etc) will be copied. You may see a little cloud icon with an X on it, indicating that the song is stored in the iTunes the library in the cloud but not from iTunes.

 2\. If the iTunes is set to copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library (default option) and the same songs are repeatedly imported from outside the media folder or are added from an external drive that saves the media folder that was offline when iTunes was launched.

3\. Songs untagged will be sorted into Unknown Artist/Unknown Album in iTunes with the name <Filename>.



### How to Stop iTunes from Duplicating Songs?

Since we have got some clues of the reason why does iTunes duplicate songs, now the problem is how to stop it doing the same thing. Below are some actions you may take to prevent iTunes from duplicating songs any longer.

**1\. Import Songs with An iTunes Alternative**

When iTunes is duplicating songs from sources other than iTunes, you can try a third alternative: add songs with other programs. You can use the famous one - [**MacX MediaTrans**](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/). It will add/export iTunes purchased tracks as well as songs, pictures, videos, ringtones, etc. downloaded, ripped or shared from other sources. It will import the songs with fast speed without duplicating any tracks.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
1\. Transfer any purchased iTunes music, playlists & albums, ripped/downloaded songs, etc. between iDevices and computer;

2\. Add and export music, photos, videos, ringtones, voice memo, etc. by drag and drop without creating duplicate copies;

3\. Manage iPhone music library, delete duplicate iTunes songs, create iPhone ringtones, make personal playlists, etc.

4\. Mount iPhone as a hard drive, remove iTunes DRM, encrypt iPhone backups, auto convert video/audio for iPhone, etc. 

 5\. The [iTunes alternative](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) will remove the restrictions and possible errors that come along with iTunes.

**2\. Disable iCloud Music Library**

There are users reporting that disabling iCloud Music Library will immediately remove all the duplicates in iTunes. By doing this, you will lose the new syncing tracks. Furthermore, this also creates problems. When iCloud Music Library is turned off, new tracks can't be synced to the iPhone. And when it is turned on, it's not allowed to drag and drop songs between Mac and iPhone. So when you get a song not from Apple Music, add it to iTunes > turn on iCloud Music Library on the Mac > upload the song to the cloud and get back all the iTunes duplicates > turn off iCloud Music Library to delete all the duplicates in iTunes.

**3\. Disable iTunes Copy to... Feature**

Since iTunes may automatically copy files to media file when it is launched, you can change the settings to stop iTunes from duplicating songs. First, you can add new tracks directly to the iTunes media folder before adding it to iTunes. Or you're suggested to disable the option "Copy files to iTunes Media folder when adding to library".
