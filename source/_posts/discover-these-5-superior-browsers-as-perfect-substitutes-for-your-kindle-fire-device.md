As a fan of Kindle Fire, I do love Kindle Fire very much, but there is one thing that Kindle Fire frustrates me. It is the **Kindle Fire browser**\--Silk browser which is designed and developed by Amazon's team. The Kindle Fire browser is supposed to be awesome and fast, but the fact goes far from its original intention of design. It is slow, unresponsive a lot and even crashes some time. Another drawback of Kindle Fire Silk browser is the wasting of space on the screen. The top and bottom space of the browser are all wasted. What's more, the Amazon doesn't offer any alternative in Amazon App Store to get as many people as possible to use the Silk browser. This action is really disappointed me. However, we always can find other ways to install the **alternatives for Kindle Fire Browser**. Here are **5 best browser for Kindle Fire** for your choice.

Before installing any of these best alternatives for Kindle Fire browser on Kindle Fire, you have to allow installation of applications that are not from Appstore. Slide down from the top of the Kindle Fire screen to find the **settings**, then select the **application** from settings, and **turn on Apps from Unknown sources**.

 No matter for Windows, MAC or Android, Google Chrome are 90% people's first choice. Want to sync your bookmark, tabs, passwords, recent research, and history to your device? If you have a Google account, you can do it perfectly with Google Chrome. You can use the incognito mode to browse the website if you do not want the browser to record where you browse and what you download. The data saver feature can compress images, fonts, and other web objects by Google server before sending out. This function will reduce mobile data usage by up to 50% while browsing. If you turn on safe browsing, you will see a warning before you navigate to a potentially dangerous website or download a potentially harmful app. Voice search is also available for Google Chrome. It also can choose from search results that instantly appear as you type and quickly access previously visited pages. 

#### Installation

[Tap here to download the Google Chrome](https://www.dropbox.com/s/c8yxy25s5bxy4nf/com.android.chrome%5F302908300.apk?dl=0) on your Kindle Fire. The downloading notification will be on the top of the screen. When the downloading of Chrome APK file is completed, tap the notification area at the top of the screen and select " Install" to finish the installation. Now you can enjoy the best **Kindle Fire web browser**.

### Dolphin

![Dolphin browser](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Dolphine-browser-for-KindleFire.png)

Dolphin is a popular browser among Android users. Since the Kindle Fire is using the Android system, Dolphin also can be the **best browser for Kindle Fire**. It offers a free, full-featured, internet browsing. As a powerful browser, Dolphin also eliminates the use of a dozen of apps from your Kindle Fire. Gesture search allows you to draw a hieroglyph and the browser will automatically recognize it and conduct the search. It also has voice search function which can liberate your hands from the keyboard. It also has the strong set of add-ons support. Tabbed browsing, incognito mode, night mode, fullscreen mode, desktop mode are all available for your choice. What's more, it enables you to sync bookmarks, tabs, history& passwords across devices. Besides above features, I like Dolphin because?user?interface is intuitive.

#### Installation

[Tap here to download the Dolphin](https://www.dropbox.com/s/snupwapxh9z44za/com.dolphin.browser.express.web%5F584.apk?dl=0) on your Kindle Fire. The downloading notification will be on the top of the screen. When the downloading is completed, tap the notification area at the top of the screen and select " Install" to finish the installation.

### Opera

![Opera browser](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Opera-mini-browser-for-KindleFire.png)

Opera is not only a well-known third party browser for PC& MAC, but also one of the best Android browser. It also can be one of the **best browser for Kindle Fire**. The latest version of Opera has featured news feed that notices the content you like and provide you more related news. Its built-in add blocker can block the pop-ups, help pages load faster and save your data. You can sync your Speed Dial shortcuts, bookmarks and tabs in Opera for Android across all your devices. With data-saving feature, you can watch more videos on your Kindle Fire which using less data. However, Opera browser is lack of add-ons. 

#### Installation

[Tap here to download the Opera](http://download.epubor.com/sold/Opera.apk)on your Kindle Fire. The downloading notification will be on the top of the screen. When the downloading is completed, tap the notification area at the top of the screen and select " Install" to finish the installation.

### FireFox

![Firefox browser](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Firefox-Browser-for-KindleFire.png)

Firefox browser has played a ruling role on PC browsers before Google has launched the Google Chrome. Although the NO. 1 position has been taken over by Google chrome, Firefox are still liked by many users, no matter for PC or Android users. If you are a Firefox user in desktop, you should not miss this best browser for Kindle Fire. It can sync all things with your desktop Firefox browser. It also have a third party add-ons which allow you add what you need and skip what you donâ€™t. Ad blocker and video downloaders are all available on this browser. It also have many other features such as night mode, private browsing and so on. It is a little bit pity that Firefox has not data saving feature.

#### Installation

[Tap here to download the Firefox APK file](http://download.epubor.com/sold/Firefox-Browser.apk)on your Kindle Fire. The downloading notification will be on the top of the screen. When the downloading is completed, tap the notification area at the top of the screen and select " Install" to finish the installation.

I wanted to compose you that little bit of observation in order to thank you yet again for the unique opinions you have featured here. This has been simply incredibly generous with you to make easily exactly what many people would've advertised as an electronic book in order to make some profit on their own, particularly given that you might have tried it if you decided. Those good ideas as well worked to become a good way to fully grasp other people online have similar fervor much like my personal own to see more and more around this problem. I believe there are thousands of more pleasant times up front for people who examine your site.

While using pretty much ANY popular browser instead of Silk is a great idea (my vote is for.Opera), there is a slightly more intimidating, but far more flexible and powerful solution... Just install Google Play Store on your Fire and get access to pretty much ALL Android apps, including those you paid for on your Android phone. Another benefit of doing your browser install via GPS is that you'll get the latest UPDATES. I've owned the 7, 8, and 10 versions of Amazon Fire, and the FIRST thing on my to-do list is to get Google Play Store on there ASAP, then all the stuff you'll never find on Amazon's store, like gmail, Google Keep (notes), Opera, Firefox, and of course all my favorite games. Just do a web search for "installing Google Play Store on Amazon Fire". There are a few good pages with clear instructions. I'll post links if anyone needs them.

How do I regain control of my fire. They overlayed Silk and it's actually chrome they're using. I can not make a Facebook account. It said something that Amazon fire has too many embedded emails. And my account is suspicious.Seriously this shot has been going on for 3 years. I know all people involved just no proof. How do I reload the firmware..Or they do something to the device like rewired the volume and power buttons and camera.and I also think something is always wreckage my the headphone jack and do m frying to do with the charger.both part-time the cable and walk plug.They also get into my cell phone PlayStation 4 and lap tops and desktops. They have some file on Netanyahu I couldn't open. But I somehow got it in Englishmen a copy savef. And once it wasn't encrypted.the file is chronium
