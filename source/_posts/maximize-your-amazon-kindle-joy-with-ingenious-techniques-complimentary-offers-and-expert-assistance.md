### Tips, freebies and service for Kindle

#### 1\. Calibre

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-calibre](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre_201292853434.png)

  
Most Kindle users are familiar with this well-known freeware, Calibre, which is generally used to convert eBooks from one format to another. In fact, Calibre offers a variety of functions besides converting eBooks.

**Get eBooks**  
Searching for eBooks on Calibre saves time & money for you. Around 50 eBook stores, including DRM-free stores are integrated into this platform for searching eBooks, where detailed description (book name, DRM status, price, store, etc.) of an eBook will be listed. You are able to get a non-DRM book at the most reasonable price.

**Fetch news**  
Calibre delivers options for your subscription to news from 1317 sources in over 40 languages. Just have a try.**[How to use Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/)**

#### 2\. lendle

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-lendle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/lendle.png)

  
lendle is a useful application to help people borrow Kindle eBooks from eBook owners and lend Kindle eBooks to others. Thus if you own at least one Kindle eBook, you are qualified to borrow Kindle books from other people. You don’t have to own any Kindle readers as you can read the lent books on your Kindle for PC or other Kindle apps. However, there are some restrictions for lendle as well. The tally of Kindle books you are allowed to borrow hinges on how many Kindle books you possess. The more Kindle books you own, the more books you can borrow. The borrowed books will belong to you for 2 weeks’ duration.  

#### 3\. Instapaper

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-instapaper](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/instapaper.png)

  
Instapaper is a simple tool to save web pages for reading later, which can be installed on computers, apple series as well as android devices. Just register for free and you can save the URL of the interesting contents for reading later. An email address will be generated at random so that you can send links to this address. Accordingly, anything you send to this address will be added to your Instapaper account.  
[How to use Instapaper for Kindle](https://david-smith.org/blog/2012/10/11/instapaper-on-the-kindle-paperwhite/) 

#### 4\. Google-related services

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Google service](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Google services.png)

**Calendar**  
As part of our daily life, Google calendar would be useful for you though the interface is kind of plain. Just launch your browser and input **www.google.com/calendar/m**. Google Calendar empowers you to add your appointments within one month.

**Email**  
Google Gmail, Hotmail alongside Facebook all contribute to Kindle.  
The following URLs for mobile will be of help.  
**m.hotmail.com** for Hotmail  
**m.gmail.com** for Google Mail  
**m.facebook.com** for Facebook

#### 5\. Quick translations: KindleFish

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-KindlFish](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindlefish.png)  
Well, this might be a miner trick for some people as there is Google Translation existing already. However, sometimes you will get perpetuated by its thumbnail characters and the inappropriate translations. KindleFish delivers big enough alphabets to satisfy our eyes and it does a perfect job on phrase translation. Nevertheless, KindleFish works perfectly for Kindle 3G while there are trivial limitations concerning characters for 1G & 2G & DX titles. Hit “**http://kindlefish.t15.org/**” and take a look at it.   
**[How to use KindleFish](http://seattleflyerguy.blogspot.com/2011/03/kindlefish-no-muss-translations-for.html)**

#### 6\. RSS: Bloglines

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service--bloglines](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/bloglines.png)

  
Together with Calibre, Google Reader, Bloglines is another good pick to subscribe RSS. Bloglines provides a friendly interface and actually attracts a cloud of Kindle customers to its territory. Just register with a new Bloglines account, pick up interesting feeds given on the site or search for blogs to your taste and add them to your created folder. Hit “subscribe” to complete your subscription.  
Go to the **www.bloglines.com** on your Kindle and sign in to reach your feeds. Bloglines brings a massive collection of feeds to you, though it is not as convenient as Kindlefeeder to some extent.  
[How to use Bloglines](http://www.slideshare.net/quiverandquill/how-to-use-bloglines-presentation)

#### 7\. RSS: Kindlefeeder

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Kindlfeeder](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindlefeeder.png)

  
KindleFeeder is an easy-to-use feed aggregator, which is unquestionably designed for Kindle regarding its name. You can set a specified time for delivery and you will receive your RSS file on your Kindle device at that time. However, you are allowed to subscribe up to 12 feeds for free and only one file is sent to you at a time, which consequently accounts for its rapid delivery.  

#### 8\. Audible Manager

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-audible manager](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible manager.png)

  
Audible is a company based on Amazon. Its product, Audible Manager, has ascended to an indispensible tool to transfer your audio files to your Amazon Kindle. Make sure Audible Manager software is installed on your PC and is used for [downloading audible books to computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Follow this guide to start with Audible Manager. Or refer to the Audible Manager user’s guide.  
[Audible Manager user’s guide download](http://download.epubor.com/sold/User's%20Guide/Audible%20Manager%20user%23U2019s%20guide.doc)

#### 9\. KinTweet

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-KinTweet](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/KinTweet.png)  
People who use twitter a lot latch onto KinTweet remarkably as it indeed does a better job than Kindle’s homepage. Follow the steps below to get to KinTweet through the built-in browser on your Kindle device.   
Kindle 3: Home ->Menu -> Experimental -> Launch Browser  
Kindle 2: Home -> Menu -> Experimental -> Basic Web -> Menu > Advanced Mode  
Navigate to **KinTweet.com** and press **S** to sign in once the page has been loaded totally.  

#### 10\. Kindle Collection Manager

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Kindle Collection Manager](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindle Collection Manager.png)  
Kindle Collection Manager enables you to organize your Kindle titles including general eBooks and audio books collections on your computer. With various techniques supported, you are able to sort out your resources by simple drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste. You can create collections from folders as well as individual contents in multi-language including Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc. One thing I have to point out is that you cannot launch Kindle Collection Manager on your computer unless your Kindle device has been connected to your computer via the USB cable. Even Kindle for PC is ineligible to drive this. Neither does Kindle Collection Manager act on Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire.  

#### 11\. Send to Kindle

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-send to Kindle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/send to kindle.png)  
Send to Kindle is a software based on PC for sending personal documents to one’s registered Kindle, official Kindle reading applications alongside Amazon Cloud. However, official Kindle reading apps supported by Send to Kindle are limited to Kindle for Android App (at least version 3.5) and Kindle App for iOS series (iPad/iPhone/iPod). Once you have Send to Kindle installed on your computer, you can [send your documents via Windows Explorer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/) or any Windows application that offers printing function to your Kindle device. Supported file types are DOC/DOCX/TXT/RTF/JPEG/JPG/GIF/PNG /BMP/PDF.

For sending documents via Windows Explorer, all non-PDF documents will be delivered in Kindle format while PDFs will remain the original format. For sending documents via any Windows application which supports printing, all documents are delivered in PDF format.

For converting PDF to Kindle format, refer to [PDF conversion on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### 12\. ABC Amber LIT Converter

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-ABC Amber KIT Converter](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ABC amber lit converter.png)

  
ABC Amber LIT Converter is an easy to use freeware aiming to convert LIT (Microsoft format) files to another popular format (PDF/HTML/HLP/RTF/CHM/TXT/DOC/WPD/RB/PDB/FB2) easily and quickly. ABC Amber LIT Converter supported DRM-protected LIT conversion, which brings along considerable convenience to customers.Multi files can be converted at one go.

However, it seems not to work well as I used it once and it failed. Then I tried Calibre and it worked effectively. Therefore Calibre is no double the first candidate for non-DRM eBooks. There is a parallel tool named ABC Ambe CHM Converter for converting CHM to PRC.

#### 13\. Mangle

You must find it’s quite inconvenient to read Manga books on Kindle as those Manga books are based on pictures rather than general docs. Here is a freeware, Mangle, which will help you convert Manga with Python’s assistance.

[How to use Mangle](http://www.howtogeek.com/62829/optimize-your-manga-and-comic-collection-for-the-kindle/)

Navigate down to "screen rotation" to select a horizontal orientation that suits you.

#### 10\. Send documents (PDF/DOC/TXT, images, etc.) to your Kindle

First, press "Menu"->"Settings" to get your device's email address (something like \*\*\*@kindle.com).  
Second, add this email address to your contacts list on your computer.  
Third, send the content you would like to read on your Kindle as attachments to your Kindle email address. The maximum of your attachments is 25.

**Email error**  
If any error occurs, it's probably due to such a fact that the emails your Kindle received come from unapproved email addresses. Start your computer to go to Amazon's "**Manage My Kindle**" page, select “**Personal Document Settings**” item and then you can add or delete your “**Approved Personal Document E-mail List**”.

**PDF conversion**  
A trick to convert PDFs to Kindle format is enabled on Kindle email scheme. Set the subject of your email as "convert" with an attachment of PDFs and send to your Kindle address (\*\*\*@kindle.com), you will receive your documents in MOBI format.

In addition to browsing on Kindle, we can send web links to kindle via email. Create a document and add your interesting links to it. Convert the document to a PDF document and send it to your Kindle email address. Open the PDF, click any link for browsing.  
An alternative is to connect your Kindle with your computer using the USB cable and copy the PDF to the “Documents" folder of your Kindle.

#### 12\. Specified prefixes for particular intentions (for Kindle 1 only)

@wiki or @wikipedia  
@store  
@time

Male voice and Female voice are provided and select a mode as you like. You can set the rate of the speech to further your listening experience. With Text-to-Speech playing, Kindle turns your book pages automatically to ensure your following in the content.

#### 14\. Kindle email checking

At times we need to check emails on Kindle. Unfortunately, there is no built-in Kindle email app for sending and receiving emails as far as I know. The single solution is to achieve this through Kindle browser with the mobile version, which is marginally plain and restricted.

1\. Menu -> Experimental -> Select  
2\. Type the address (mobile version) of your email provider into the URL box to **Submit**.  
The address of mobile version comes easy. Just add an “**m**” to the head of the regular URL.

m.hotmail.com (Hotmail)  
3\. Sign in with your username and password to check your email on Kindle.

First **plug your Kindle device to computer via USB cable**, when they are connected, the Kindle screen will change to show you the device enters USB drive mode. Open the **"documents"** folder you can see the file **"My Clippings.txt"**. Then you can easily copy it and paste in your computer's hard drive, to edit it, manage it, organize it to your private quotations book, or print it out.

#### 17\. Delete books from Kindle permanently

We all know how to delete books on Kindle device. Just locate the cursor under the book and press the rocker to the left. Or press the middle button under a specified book and scroll down to select “delete”.  
But sometimes we need to delete Kindle eBooks for good. In this case, we have to go to “Amazon.com“ to complete the operation.   
1\. Click “Your account”, select “Manage My Kindle”   
2\. Select “Books” on the left “Your Kindle Library” zone. Locate the cursor on the “Actions…” button of the book you are to delete permanently and select “Delete from library”.  
3\. Click “Yes” on the following warning window if you are sure you want to delete that book.

Here is a detailed guide about [how to delete Kindle books from device and cloud](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### 18\. Zoom PDF on Kindle

Sometimes we find it annoying to read PDF files on Kindle. This guide covers [how to zoom PDF on Kindle Step by step](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### 19\. Print Kindle books

Imagine you have a recipe on Kindle, isn’t it nice to have a paper copy at hand? Absolutely! However, there is even no “Print” button on Kindle for PC as we know. On the contrary, EPUB and PDF files are allowed to print on Adobe Digital Editions with print button supported.  
1) For non-DRM-ed MOBI books, you can directly use free Calibre to convert MOBI to EPUB so as to print out your Kindle books (pages).  
2) For DRM protected AZW/TPZ/PRC books, well, you have to remove Kindle DRM and then repeat last step.   
[How to print kindle books](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

#### 20\. Sync Kindle books

Kindle exclusively supports purchased Kindle eBook sync. For books purchased from Amazon, you are allowed to sync the page you left off and continue to read on another device installed Kindle app. For free books from public domains, there is actually a web-based eReader, ibis reader, which is able to help sync eBooks but not so ideal to some extent. Have a go if you are in need of this function.

#### 21\. Manually transfer purchased books to Kindle device/app

Some people may meet this problem, they purchased a book from Amazon, but the book didn't show up in their Kindle device or app. Now you can manually transfer the book to your Kindle device or app.

First go to Amazon and enter "Manage Your Kindle"

Google reader has been discontinued, please update! I'm desperate for a replacement service that will send any RSS to my kindle free - anyone found such a thing?
