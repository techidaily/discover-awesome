### Tips, freebies and service for Kindle

#### 1\. Calibre

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-calibre](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/calibre_201292853434.png)

  
Most Kindle users are familiar with this well-known freeware, Calibre, which is generally used to convert eBooks from one format to another. In fact, Calibre offers a variety of functions besides converting eBooks.

**Get eBooks**  
Searching for eBooks on Calibre saves time & money for you. Around 50 eBook stores, including DRM-free stores are integrated into this platform for searching eBooks, where detailed description (book name, DRM status, price, store, etc.) of an eBook will be listed. You are able to get a non-DRM book at the most reasonable price.

**Fetch news**  
Calibre delivers options for your subscription to news from 1317 sources in over 40 languages. Just have a try.**[How to use Calibre](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ebook-converter/)**

#### 2\. lendle

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-lendle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/lendle.png)

  
lendle is a useful application to help people borrow Kindle eBooks from eBook owners and lend Kindle eBooks to others. Thus if you own at least one Kindle eBook, you are qualified to borrow Kindle books from other people. You don’t have to own any Kindle readers as you can read the lent books on your Kindle for PC or other Kindle apps. However, there are some restrictions for lendle as well. The tally of Kindle books you are allowed to borrow hinges on how many Kindle books you possess. The more Kindle books you own, the more books you can borrow. The borrowed books will belong to you for 2 weeks’ duration.  

#### 3\. Instapaper

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-instapaper](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/instapaper.png)

  
Instapaper is a simple tool to save web pages for reading later, which can be installed on computers, apple series as well as android devices. Just register for free and you can save the URL of the interesting contents for reading later. An email address will be generated at random so that you can send links to this address. Accordingly, anything you send to this address will be added to your Instapaper account.  
[How to use Instapaper for Kindle](https://david-smith.org/blog/2012/10/11/instapaper-on-the-kindle-paperwhite/) 

#### 4\. Google-related services

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Google service](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Google services.png)

**Calendar**  
As part of our daily life, Google calendar would be useful for you though the interface is kind of plain. Just launch your browser and input **www.google.com/calendar/m**. Google Calendar empowers you to add your appointments within one month.

**Email**  
Google Gmail, Hotmail alongside Facebook all contribute to Kindle.  
The following URLs for mobile will be of help.  
**m.hotmail.com** for Hotmail  
**m.gmail.com** for Google Mail  
**m.facebook.com** for Facebook

#### 5\. Quick translations: KindleFish

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-KindlFish](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/kindlefish.png)  
Well, this might be a miner trick for some people as there is Google Translation existing already. However, sometimes you will get perpetuated by its thumbnail characters and the inappropriate translations. KindleFish delivers big enough alphabets to satisfy our eyes and it does a perfect job on phrase translation. Nevertheless, KindleFish works perfectly for Kindle 3G while there are trivial limitations concerning characters for 1G & 2G & DX titles. Hit “**http://kindlefish.t15.org/**” and take a look at it.

#### 6\. RSS: Bloglines

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service--bloglines](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/bloglines.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




  
Together with Calibre, Google Reader, Bloglines is another good pick to subscribe RSS. Bloglines provides a friendly interface and actually attracts a cloud of Kindle customers to its territory. Just register with a new Bloglines account, pick up interesting feeds given on the site or search for blogs to your taste and add them to your created folder. Hit “subscribe” to complete your subscription.  
Go to the **www.bloglines.com** on your Kindle and sign in to reach your feeds. Bloglines brings a massive collection of feeds to you, though it is not as convenient as Kindlefeeder to some extent.  
[How to use Bloglines](http://www.slideshare.net/quiverandquill/how-to-use-bloglines-presentation)

#### 7\. RSS: Kindlefeeder

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Kindlfeeder](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindlefeeder.png)

  
KindleFeeder is an easy-to-use feed aggregator, which is unquestionably designed for Kindle regarding its name. You can set a specified time for delivery and you will receive your RSS file on your Kindle device at that time. However, you are allowed to subscribe up to 12 feeds for free and only one file is sent to you at a time, which consequently accounts for its rapid delivery.  

#### 8\. Audible Manager

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-audible manager](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/audible manager.png)

Audible is a company based on Amazon. Its product, Audible Manager, has ascended to an indispensible tool to transfer your audio files to your Amazon Kindle. Make sure Audible Manager software is installed on your PC and is used for [downloading audible books to computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/). Follow this guide to start with Audible Manager. Or refer to the Audible Manager user’s guide.

#### 9\. KinTweet

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-KinTweet](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/KinTweet.png)  
People who use twitter a lot latch onto KinTweet remarkably as it indeed does a better job than Kindle’s homepage. Follow the steps below to get to KinTweet through the built-in browser on your Kindle device.

Kindle 3: Home ->Menu -> Experimental -> Launch Browser  
Kindle 2: Home -> Menu -> Experimental -> Basic Web -> Menu > Advanced Mode  
Navigate to **KinTweet.com** and press **S** to sign in once the page has been loaded totally.  

#### 10\. Kindle Collection Manager

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-Kindle Collection Manager](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/Kindle Collection Manager.png)  
Kindle Collection Manager enables you to organize your Kindle titles including general eBooks and audio books collections on your computer. With various techniques supported, you are able to sort out your resources by simple drag-and-drop or copy-and-paste. You can create collections from folders as well as individual contents in multi-language including Russian, Chinese, Japanese, etc. One thing I have to point out is that you cannot launch Kindle Collection Manager on your computer unless your Kindle device has been connected to your computer via the USB cable. Even Kindle for PC is ineligible to drive this. Neither does Kindle Collection Manager act on Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire.

#### 11\. Send to Kindle

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-send to Kindle](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/send to kindle.png)  
Send to Kindle is a software based on PC for sending personal documents to one’s registered Kindle, official Kindle reading applications alongside Amazon Cloud.

Supported file types are DOC/DOCX/TXT/RTF/JPEG/JPG/GIF/PNG /BMP/PDF.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->





For sending documents via Windows Explorer, all non-PDF documents will be delivered in Kindle format while PDFs will remain the original format. For sending documents via any Windows application which supports printing, all documents are delivered in PDF format.

For converting PDF to Kindle format, refer to [PDF conversion on Kindle](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/).

#### 12\. ABC Amber LIT Converter

![kindle tips-tricks-freebies-service-ABC Amber KIT Converter](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/ABC amber lit converter.png)

  
ABC Amber LIT Converter is an easy to use freeware aiming to convert LIT (Microsoft format) files to another popular format (PDF/HTML/HLP/RTF/CHM/TXT/DOC/WPD/RB/PDB/FB2) easily and quickly. ABC Amber LIT Converter supported DRM-protected LIT conversion, which brings along considerable convenience to customers.Multi files can be converted at one go.

However, it seems not to work well as I used it once and it failed. Then I tried Calibre and it worked effectively. Therefore Calibre is no double the first candidate for non-DRM eBooks. There is a parallel tool named ABC Ambe CHM Converter for converting CHM to PRC.

#### 13\. Mangle

You must find it’s quite inconvenient to read Manga books on Kindle as those Manga books are based on pictures rather than general docs. Here is a freeware, Mangle, which will help you convert Manga with Python’s assistance.

### Kindle-related tips and tricks

We collect a heap of regular tips and tricks for Kindle according to **Business Insider** and some other websites.

#### 1\. Little games: built-in Minesweeper & Gomoku

Hold down **ALT, Shift** together with **M** to enter Minesweeper.  
Tap **G** to go to Gomoku from Minesweeper.

#### 2\. Check the free space of your Kindle

Tap the “Menu” button and the number of your kindle’s free space will show up at the top left corner of your screen.

#### 3\. Faster to browse the web (have been mentioned above)

For web browsing, navigating to mobile pages instead of traditional ones makes your browsing even faster.  
Mobile pages:  
**m.gmail.com**  
**google.com/reader/m**  
**mobile.twitter.com**

#### 4\. Restart Kindle

Turn off your Kindle by sliding and holding the power button for around 7 seconds. Or directly keep holding your Kindle for 15 seconds’ duration to restart the gadget. 

#### 5\. Basic calculation through typing

For basic calculations like 100+100, just type the characters in the search bar and press **Enter** to get the output. You can also input a random URL, right click the 5-way controller and select “go to” to see what happens.

#### 6\. Capture Kindle’s screen

Holding down **Shift**, **ALT**, and **G** all at the same time helps you capture Kindle’s screen. The captured photo is typically saved in the folder named "Documents”. You can copy the photos to your disc with your Kindle connected to your computer via the USB cable.

#### 7\. Consult a dictionary

Press **down** on the 5-way controller and locate your cursor on a word. You will see the definition at the bottom of your screen. Press **Enter** for detailed explanation and press **Back** button to return to the content.

#### 8\. Shortcuts

**For playing music**  
In addition to the "experimental" MP3 player, following shortcuts will make your playing music convenient and flexible.  
**ALT + Space**: stop or start music  
**ALT + F**: skip to the next track  
**ALT + any top keyboard key**: type numbers quickly

**Other shortcuts**  
**Alt + B**: bookmark the current page  
**Alt + Shift + G:** capture a screen shot for current screen  
**Alt + Shift + M**: start little game “Minesweeper”  
**Alt + G:** refresh the screen and eliminate ghosting;   
**Alt + R**: reload current web page.

#### 9\. Turn your Kindle sideways for comfortable reading

Make sure to activate this function by tapping the "Aa" button in the bottom row of your keyboard.  
Navigate down to "screen rotation" to select a horizontal orientation that suits you.

#### 10\. Send documents (PDF/DOC/TXT, images, etc.) to your Kindle

First, press "Menu"->"Settings" to get your device's email address (something like \*\*\*@kindle.com).  
Second, add this email address to your contacts list on your computer.  
Third, send the content you would like to read on your Kindle as attachments to your Kindle email address. The maximum of your attachments is 25.

**Email error**  
If any error occurs, it's probably due to such a fact that the emails your Kindle received come from unapproved email addresses. Start your computer to go to Amazon's "**Manage My Kindle**" page, select “**Personal Document Settings**” item and then you can add or delete your “**Approved Personal Document E-mail List**”.

**PDF conversion**  
A trick to convert PDFs to Kindle format is enabled on Kindle email scheme. Set the subject of your email as "convert" with an attachment of PDFs and send to your Kindle address (\*\*\*@kindle.com), you will receive your documents in MOBI format.

#### 11\. Add web page bookmarks to your Kindle home screen

In addition to browsing on Kindle, we can send web links to kindle via email. Create a document and add your interesting links to it. Convert the document to a PDF document and send it to your Kindle email address. Open the PDF, click any link for browsing.  
An alternative is to connect your Kindle with your computer using the USB cable and copy the PDF to the “Documents" folder of your Kindle.

#### 12\. Specified prefixes for particular intentions (for Kindle 1 only)

For searching on Kindle 1, use special prefixes to redirect your search for particular intentions.  
@help  
@web  
@wiki or @wikipedia  
@store  
@time  
Pressing **Enter** on home screen will bring up a search window. If you use Kindle 2, navigate to right on the 5-way controller to select from those choices.

#### 13\. Listen to Kindle books (Text-to-Speech function)

Some people find their reasons to listen to Kindle books thus TTS (Text-to-Speech) constitutes a part of Kindle’s function. To turn on this function, just open an Amazon Kindle book, press the **Menu** button and shift TEXT-TO-SPEECH setting to ON.  
Male voice and Female voice are provided and select a mode as you like. You can set the rate of the speech to further your listening experience. With Text-to-Speech playing, Kindle turns your book pages automatically to ensure your following in the content.

#### 14\. Kindle email checking

At times we need to check emails on Kindle. Unfortunately, there is no built-in Kindle email app for sending and receiving emails as far as I know. The single solution is to achieve this through Kindle browser with the mobile version, which is marginally plain and restricted.

1\. Menu -> Experimental -> Select  
2\. Type the address (mobile version) of your email provider into the URL box to **Submit**.  
The address of mobile version comes easy. Just add an “**m**” to the head of the regular URL.  
Examples:  
m.gmail.com (Gmail)  
m.hotmail.com (Hotmail)  
3\. Sign in with your username and password to check your email on Kindle.

#### 15\. Kindle user’s guide series download

[**Kindle (1st Generation)**](http://download.epubor.com/sold/User's%20Guide/kindle%20user%23U2018s%20guide/Kindle%20%281st%20Generation%29.pdf)
