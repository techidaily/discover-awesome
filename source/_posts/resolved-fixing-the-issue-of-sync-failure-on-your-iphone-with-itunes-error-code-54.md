2). Check if it's your third-party security software to be blamed.

3). Sync a handful of iPhone files at a time.

4). Delete and re-download content from iTunes Store.

### 2\. Change Permissions

1). Go to /private/var/mobile/Media/Photos and change the permission to 755 (or 777 if 755 is not working). 

2). Find Thumbs and Photo folders from /private/var/mobile/Media/Photos/, make a copy of these two folders and then delete them.

3). Now sync your iPhone with iTunes to see if it works.

### 3\. Delete Apple Mobile Device Support, Apple Software Update...

This solution is suitable for Windows users to fix "[the iPhone cannot be synced issue](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)" caused by iTunes 54 error. Now read the detailed operating steps:

1). Run the computer menu > enter "regedit" > click & open HKEY-current-user, software and apple computer inc > open iTunes and QuickTime folder > delete all the files that you can delete (keep the files if they can't be erased).

2). Access to Microsoft official website > download and install "Windows Installer Clean Up" > launch it and delete "Apple Mobile Device Support", "Apple Software Update", "iTunes" and "iPhone Software" > choose these software and tap "Remove". 

3). Delete iTunes and QuickTime on the computer control panel.

4). Head to Apple official website to re-download and install iTunes. Afterwards, connect your iPhone to sync again.
