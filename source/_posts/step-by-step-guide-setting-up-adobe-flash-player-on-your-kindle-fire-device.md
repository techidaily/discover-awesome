For **owners of the first generation of Kindle Fire** (released in 2011), simply tap "**Web**" on the top navigation bar to launch the browser, tap the **menu** (or options) icon at the bottom, then "**Settings**", scroll down to "**Enable Flash**" and choose "**Always on**". Relaunch your browser and you will be able to play video on your Kindle Fire.

For **owners of Kindle Fire 2 and Kindle Fire HD**, things are a bit complicated, as there is even no "Flash Player" setting on the device. In this case, you can follow steps below.

### Step-by-step to install Flash Player on your Kindle Fire (HD).

#### **Here are the tools you will need:**

1\. Dolphin Browser (v8.5.1).

2\. Kindle Fire Flash Player.

Since Kindle Fire's built-in silk browser does not support Flash Player by default, we will have to use external Dolphon browser instead.  

**Step1** **Enable application installation from unknown sources on Kindle Fire**. Tap the top right corner on the screen to choose "**More**" -> "**Device**", then turn on "**Allow Installation of Applications**".

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step2** **Install Dolphin Browser and Kindle Fire Flash Player on your Kindle Fire.**

**Install Dolphin Browser app.**

![install Dolphin Browser on Kindle Fire](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/flash_install_dolphin.png)

Launch the built-in browser on your Kindle Fire, input the following string bit.ly/N0tGoL on the browser (case sensitive), Dolphin Browser APK (installation file) will be downloaded to your Kindle Fire. When the downloading is done, there will be a "**Download done**" notification on the top of the screen. Tap to install Dolphin Browser on your Kindle Fire. The file name is "Dolphin\_Browser\_HD\_8.5.1.apk".

  
**Install Flash Player app.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
This is similar to the installation of Dolphin Browser. Type in the following URL **d-h.st/x4v** on the browser, tap the black download button under the image to download the Flash Player app. When the downloading is over, tap to install. The file name is "install\_flash\_player\_ics (1).apk".

  
**Step3** **Launch Dolphin Browser on your Kindle Fire.**

Go back to the home screen. Navigate to "**Apps**" and select "**Device**" to launch Dolphin Browser. Tap "**Start now**" -> "**Accept**" -> "**Always on**" (Flash Support) and "**Desktop**" (Perform as) -> "**Next**" -> "**Skip**" -> "**Finish**".

![launch Dolphin Browser on Kindle Fire](https://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/flash_dolphin.png)

  
**Check the result.**

Go to a video site and check.

Hi, alex

 As long as the given link is launched, the file will be downloaded. The correct file name of dolphin installation is "Dolphin\_Browser\_HD\_8.5.1.apk". Make sure the file is fully downloaded.

Hi, your instructions were good but when the download said it was done, I went to click on it only to find that it had gone and all I got was no nothing but time wasted. So what do I do because it isn't showing up anywhere not even on the apps page on the Kindle Fire 7".

Instructions worked flawlessly the first time around.

 \--- FOR ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE DOWNLOADING THE LINKS ---   
 Silk either does not like the links or the sites are having intermittent problems.

 SOLUTION: we are going to manually "Side-load" the files.

 Step 1: Download both files with your desktop or laptop computer. If you get a dialog box, SAVE the file. 

 Step 2: Connect your Kindle Fire to your computer. 

 Step 3: Move both the Dolphin browser and the flash browser files to your Kindle. I suggest the "Downloads" folder for a _location._ Those are the two files you just downloaded that end in ".apk". If you have "hide file extensions" on your computer, look for the file names themselves.

 DO NOT MOVE, DELETE, OR RENAME ANY OTHER FILES ON YOUR KINDLE WHILE DOING THIS!

 Step 4: Browse to the "Downloads" folder or wherever you moved the two .apk files and install the Dolphin browser FIRST\*. Do not open it yet. Install the Flash player. Do not open THAT either. 

 Step 5: Open Dolphin explorer and skip through the first few pages. Open any major video-sharing site as a test (like Youtube or Vimeo) and see if it works. 

 \*IMPORTANT: --If you do not have the program "ES File Explorer"---, you will need to install that FIRST (or an equivalent program) so you can browse on your Kindle like you can on your computer to any folder you want. Otherwise you're stuck with the Kindle's graphical interface. If you are uncomfortable 'browsing' your kindle or have never done it before, ask a tech-savvy person.
