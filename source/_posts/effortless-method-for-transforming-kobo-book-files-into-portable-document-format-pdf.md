Most of Kobo ebooks are ePub format. But for some reasons, you may want to convert your Kobo ebooks to PDF, in order to read them with a PDF reader or print them to paper books on hand. However, that's not that easy to convert Kobo ebooks to PDF on your own, because most Kobo ebooks are protected by DRM. After struggling for hours to download and test software, we've found a solution that could convert Kobo books to PDF with high quality. It only takes four steps. Let's have a look and follow my steps.

* [Step 1\. Download Kobo eBooks to Your Computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Step 2\. Download and Install Epubor Ultimate to Your Computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Step 3\. Remove DRM from Kobo eBooks](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)
* [Step 4\. Convert Kobo eBooks to PDF](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/products/)

### Step 1\. Download Kobo eBooks to Your Computer

_There are 2 ways to get Kobo books downloaded to your PC/Mac. Choose one that you prefer._  

#### 1 **Download Kobo books from Kobo website**.

Go to your Kobo Library in a web browser and sign in with your Kobo account. You will find all your purchased books there. Now click on the three dots button under the book cover, then click "Download" at the drop-down list. Usually the book will be downloaded as **URLLink.acsm** file, not epub or pdf file. You should open the ACSM files with Adobe Digital Editions to get the epub or pdf books.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




#### 2 **Download Kobo books from Kobo for PC/Mac desktop**.

Download and install Kobo desktop app for PC/Mac. Log in with your Kobo account. It will automatically sync your Kobo library. Just click on the "Download" icon at bottom right of the book cover. When the book has been downloaded, the download icon will disappear.

![download kobo books via kobo desktop](http://www.epubor.com/images/uppic/download-kobo-books-via-kobo-desktop.png)

 After downloading, you will get a **.kepub** file instead of epub book. It's hard to find on your computer, because it's hidden by default. 

### Step 2\. Download and Install Epubor Ultimate to Your Computer

We have tried many software to remove the DRM from Kobo books and convert Kobo to PDF, such as Calibre, online ebook converter, but none of them work perfect. At last, I found [Epubor Ultimate](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/). It is an all-in-one ebook DRM removal and ebook converter. Click the following Download button to get this powerful tool.

### Step 3\. Remove DRM from Kobo eBooks

Run Epubor Ultimate. It will automatically detect and show all your downloaded Kobo books, no matter they are from Adobe Digital Editions or Kobo for PC/Mac desktop. You don't need to find the books manually. Kobo books opened with Adobe Digital Editions will be shown under the "Adobe" tab. And Kobo books downloaded via Kobo for PC/Mac will be displayed under the "Kobo" tab.

Now Drag & drop the books from the left column to the right main interface, the DRM protection will be removed automatically.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->




Importance: Own a Kobo device at hand? Things become easy. Directly connect your Kobo via USB to computer, then the Epubor Ultimate will recongnize your device and display all of the downloaded kobo books stored in your device. 

### Step 4\. Convert Kobo eBooks to PDF

At the bottom of the software, choose PDF as the output format and then click **Convert to PDF** button. The conversion will start. You will get the PDF soon.

 And you can find the converted PDF file by clicking **Succeeded** or the **Folder icon** on the lower right corner of the software.

Hi,  
 What happens if my book is protected by Adobe DRM and I move the protection?   
 I don't get why I have to install adobe digital editions?

 All the best

hi,  
 If you remove the DRM from Kobo books, you can back up them. 

 If you have installed the Kobo for pc/mac on your computer, you can sync your books via this app. Then run Epubor software to remove the DRM(Kobo drm). 

 If you sync your Kobo book via ADE, you will get the books with DRM(Adobe adept DRM). Then run Epubor software to remove the DRM.

Thanks for the tutorial, appreciate it.

 The only problem is that 'epubor ultimate' requires one to purchase a license for a good conversion. The free version does not provide a good quality conversion.

 The following test is mentioned when one converts using the free 'epubor ultimate'

 "  
 Your ebook has decrypted.  
 The TXT file just save 20% of ebook content.  
 Please register the software, then get all contents and the valid ebook format.  
 "

Yes, the free trial will only save 20% of each book. The licensed version will give you the full content. Now the christmas promotion is still on. You can purchase the software with 20% discount off. The coupon is"XMAS2017"

Kind of defeats the point, doesn't it??? Is this genuine help, or simply advertising dressed up as a helpful hand??
