When buying or reading a book, at the first glance you intested in is the cover, yes? For paper books after we choose one book we can't change the cover any more. But unlike the paper books, for eBooks it's possible to change their covers.

Probably there are some people like to change epub cover calibre, but if you are not so professional at computer, this recommended program [Ultimate Converter](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) maybe your type. It's easy to use.

Firstly get it downloaded for free.

[Windows Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/) [Mac Version Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/epubor/ultimate/)

Then here is a guide how to use this Ultimate Converter.

### Step1: Load epub books

Run this tool, then click "Add" button to load epub books you want to change cover.

As the image shows, either your epub books are DRMed or DRM free, you can still load them to this program.

Is there a way to make sure that the cover image is seen on the epub file when viewed in Windows Explorer?
