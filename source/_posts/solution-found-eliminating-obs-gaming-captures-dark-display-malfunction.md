### Solution 1\. Run OBS as Administrator

Some features of OBS may be blocked by Windows system as your computer don’t trust the third-party application installed, so OBS can’t make full use of its all features. By running OBS as administrator, OBS won’t be blocked by your computer as well as other programs.

**How-to:** Right click on OBS icon and select "Run as administrator".

Note: On Windows computer, Game Mode and Game Bar are designed for gamers to enjoy the best Xbox gaming experience as well as capture games, broadcast gameplay online and take screenshots. As it will conflict with OBS game capture, turning it off is highly suggested.

### Solution 2\. Use the Right Sources

There are 3 main capturing modes in OBS for you to screen recording games or computer display. Among them, Game Capture is the best one to record gameplays. Sometimes, Window Capture and Display Capture allows for game capturing, but most of the time they give you a black screen.

![Use Game Capture in OBS](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/obs-game-capture.jpg) 

Use Game Capture in OBS

### Solution 3\. Let OBS and Your Game Use the Same Graphics Card

Sometimes, OBS not capturing game issue is because your OBS game recorder and your game are running on different graphics cards. Simply let OBS and the target game run on the same graphics adapter to get a proper game capture.

**How-to guide:** 

1. Run Nvidia Control Panel and select Manage 3D settings > click Program Settings in the right panel
2. Click Add > click Browse and navigate to OBS.exe > right-click on the OBS icon and select Open file location to locate its path.
3. Choose High-performance NVIDIA processor and click Apply > close Nvidia Control Panel
4. Restart your OBS.

![Switch Graphics Cards](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/switch-graphics-cards.jpg) 

Switch Graphics Cards

### Solution 4\. Use High-performance GPU on computer with multiple GPUs

If you are using a laptop or all-in-one computer with multiple GPU graphics cards, make sure your OBS recorder and the game you are running are using the High-performance GPU. 

Some users might think your OBS and games would automatically activate the strongest GPU or prefer discrete GPU to integrated GPU. However, that's not always the case. Let's take Minecraft: Java Edition and osu! for instance. The default GPU of this game is the inferior integrated GPU on multi-GPU systems, not the more powerful discrete GPU graphics card. 

Therefore, if your game doesn't take the strongest GPU as default setting in game recording with OBS, change the game to the high-performance GPU, then restart the game and OBS Studio on your multi-GPU computer.

### Solution 5\. Update Graphics Drivers

 OBS Studio and the game you are capturing, both require your graphics drivers being updated to the latest build. If they are problematic or outdated, your chance to incur OBS not capturing game or OBS black screen issue arises badly. 

Under this circumstance, you're suggested to uninstall your existing graphics drivers and to install newer ones later on.

**How-to uninstall and re-install latest graphics drivers:** 

1. Download and install DDU (Display driver uninstaller) from its official website.
2. After installing DDU on your laptop, run your PC in safe mode. Then opt for the first option "Clean and restart" on DDU. This will uninstall the current drivers completely from your computer.
3. Boot your computer as usual (not in safe mode).
4. Press Windows + R > type "devmgmt.msc" in the dialogue box > hit Enter keyboard > right -click on any empty space and choose "Search for hardware changes". The default drivers will be installed. Now fire up the Display Capture and check if this works this problem out.
5. Optionally: install the latest graphics drivers through Windows update or navigate to your manufacturer's website to download the latest ones if the default drivers still failed to help you out of the trouble.

![Update graphics drivers](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/update-drive-for-obs.jpg) 

6. Restart your computer and check if the OBS not capturing game problem gets resolved.

### Solution 6\. Enable the Compatibility Mode

**How-to:** Right-click on OBS icon and choose "Properties" > tick "Run this program in compatibility mode for" under "Compatibility" tab > click Apply and OK > restart OBS to see if it solves the error.

### Solution 7\. Upgrade or Downgrade OBS

Sometimes, it is not the fault of your OBS but the games themselves as they have Anticheat, so OBS updates itself frequently to record the latest games. Therefore, you should download the latest version of OBS to capture new games. On the contrary, if your OBS won’t capture game after OBS upgrading, you can try to reinstall the previous working version to have a try.

### Solution 8\. Check OBS Settings

If you mistakenly change your OBS settings, OBS game capture black screen may occur. So, check the settings one by one or just reset all the settings to the original to solve the error.

### Solution 9\. Remove Unused Sources You Created

If you have created too many sources, they may conflict with each other when capturing gameplays. So, deleted the unused sources and leave the only sources you need to avoid OBS game capturing not working problem.

![Remove OBS Sources](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/remove-obs-sources.jpg) 

Remove OBS Sources

### Solution 10\. Do not Close Eye

If there is a forward slash on the eye next to "Game Capture" in "Sources", it means you have turned it off. Consequently, you see nothing but black screen in the recording section in OBS. So, click the eye icon to turn it on.

![Turn on OBS Eye](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/turn-on-obs-eye.jpg) 

Turn on OBS Eye

### Solution 11\. Stretch Out the Recording Screen

When you add a new Game Capture in OBS, there is a red dot displays on the top left corner of the recording window inside OBS. Just expand the red dot from top left corner to the bottom right corner to fill the screen to full screen capture games with OBS.

![Stretch out OBS Record Screen](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/stretch-out-obs-record-screen.jpg) 

Stretch out OBS Record Screen

### Solution 12\. Shut down the conflicting software

Check for Known Application Conflicts, include but not limited to overlays, FPS counters, anti-virus programs, etc. Some applications, if not all, like Rivatuner/MSI Afterburner are especially prevalent conflicts, notwithstanding they have always been listed as such. Exit the conflicting software from your Windows PC or macOS before you proceed recording screen game video using OBS. 

If it's RTSS version 7.3.2 or newer model installed on your laptop, you can enable compatibility with OBS by selecting the "Use Microsoft Detours API hooking" option in RTSS' Setup to avoid the maddening software conflicting issue.

### Solution 13\. Change Games DX12 API to DX11 API

The GPU graphics API also matter a lot in gameplay video capturing via OBS. Some DX12 games may encounter black screen, game crash or weird frame error when it's in DX12 API mode during OBS game recording. 

To tackle this issue, try DirectX 11 API if your game supports this API mode.

### 14\. Disable Other OBS Studio-like Application

If you have any other streaming or video recording software on your Windows PC or macOS, there is high likelihood that it must be in the way of the working of OBS studio. If that's the case, no wonder OBS is unable to record the game video. As a solution, disable or uninstall the OBS studio similar applications to fix the problem. 

Furthermore, an antivirus program can also disturb OBS Studio's working. Thus, turn off or exit the antivirus, whenever you are using the studio, and check if it makes any difference.

### 15\. Turn Off the Game Mode

Windows 11 comes with a dedicated game mode feature. It enhances the gaming experience up to a great extent. However, it can be another potential risk to cause OBS game capturing black screen issue. Consequently, disable the game mode feature to fix the problem. Here's how to: 

* Open the Windows settings by pressing Windows + I hotkeys.
* Click Gaming option at the left of the screen.
* Select Game Mode.
* Turn off the Game Mode option.

That's it. Restart your system, open OBS Studio, and record a game video on your laptop.

## Part 3\. How to Solve OBS Game Capture not Showing Up on Mac?

The Syphon Inject (which comes with OBS) does not function properly in macOS 10.14 Mojave since 2020, which means that OBS Game Capture is only a feature on Windows but cannot be used on Mac anymore. It is suggested that using Window Capture or Display Capture can also record your games. But from my experience, it is not that ideal.

## Part 4\. How to Solve OSB Won't Capture Game in Full Screen?

To let OBS capture game in full screen, you should make sure the settings inside OBS are right. 

**Solution 1.** When you create a new Game Capture task, choose "Capture any fullscreen application" from the drop down menu of Mode when Properties window pops up. 

![OBS Game Capture Fullscreen](https://www.macxdvd.com/mac-dvd-video-converter-how-to/article-image/obs-fullscreen-mode.jpg) 

OBS Game Capture Fullscreen

**Solution 2.** Stretch out the red dot from top left corner to the bottom right corner to perfectly match the recording window. Note, do not exceed the window.

**Solution 3.** There is another case in OBS not capturing game in full screen. OBS application will stop rendering when you alt+tab out a game and the game is tuned to run in full-screen mode. This means your game in OBS won't show up while OBS is minimized. The workarounds go to: make a test recording and check it to verify the capture functioned normally, or move OBS recorder software to a second monitor to try again. 

Meanwhile, emulators and older games are often incompatible with modern game capture software like OBS. Providing you are having issues with OBS in capturing game in full screen, try OBS alternative (below) to record game video without issue.
